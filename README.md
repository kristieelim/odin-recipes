# odin-recipes
GitHub repo for the project "Recipes" in The Odin Project

A simple recipe website using only HTML.
This website consists of the homepage and three recipe webpages. The homepage links to all recipe webpages. All webpages have an image.

Through this project, I have learned the following:

- the html boilerplate
- html tags: paragraphs, strong, etc.
- headings
- ordered and unordered lists
- images (from a local folder and from the web)
- links
- basic terminal commands
- basic git commands
